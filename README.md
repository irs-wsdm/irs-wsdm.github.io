## Summary

Recommender systems have been widely applied in different scenarios of our daily lives. Existing recommender systems mainly focus on predicting the user’s future behaviors (e.g., rating, clicking, watching, and purchasing) items but ignore the interactions between the user and the recommender agent. Therefore, they usually generate un-satisfactory recommendation results and cause bad user experience. This motivates the development of interactive recommender systems (IRS) that encourage the interactions between the user and the recommender agent. In recent years, interactive recommender systems have attracted increasingly research attentions from both academia and industry. This workshop provides a forum for researchers and practitioners to share the new techniques and applications of interactive recommender systems, and discuss the future research directions. 

## Call for Papers

This workshop welcomes submissions from both academia and industry researchers relevant to interactive recommender systems. Topics of interests include but are not limited to:
- Bandit learning for interactive recommender systems
- Deep reinforcement learning for interactive recommender systems
- Conversational recommender systems
- Multi-modal conversational recommender systems
- Critiquing-based recommender systems
- Human decision making in interactive recommender systems
- Human-recommender interaction in recommender systems
- Fairness in interactive recommender systems
- Diversified interactive recommender systems
- Explanatory interactive recommender systems
- Knowledge-enhanced interactive recommender systems
- Personalized interaction mechanism design
- User simulation for interactive recommender systems
- Methodology for evaluating interactive recommender systems

Submissions must be in PDF, up to 8 pages long (plus unlimited pages for references), and shorter papers are also welcome. All manuscripts should be formatted according to the new ACM format published in ACM guidelines, selecting the generic “sigconf” sample. Papers can be submitted through easychair: https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=irswsdm23.

All submitted papers will be pear reviewed by the program committee. Accepted submissions will be presented at the workshop and published on the workshop’s website, but will not be archived.
