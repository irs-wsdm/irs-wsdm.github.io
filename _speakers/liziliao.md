content-title: <nobr> On the Proactiveness in Conversational Search and Recommendation </nobr>

content-speak: Search and recommendation systems suffer from the basic information asymmetry problem between the user and system. Conversation offers a natural and convenient way to bridge the two. Although various findings or models have been reported in research papers and deployed in real systems, the proactiveness of such conversation systems has been less investigated. In this talk, I will first introduce the proactive conversation paradigm and then discuss methods to equip conversational search and recommenders with the ability to interact with end users in a more proactive way.
