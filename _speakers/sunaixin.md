content-speak: Recommender System (RecSys) has been heavily researched for more than 20 years. There are not short of RecSys models in research publications, or practical systems that support our daily needs. Although various experiments have been reported in research papers, the evaluation of RecSys has not been a key focus. In this talk, I will review the challenges in evaluating RecSys and then discuss the possible challenges in evaluating interactive RecSys.
