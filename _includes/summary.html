                       Recommender systems have been widely applied in different scenarios of our daily lives. Existing recommender systems mainly focus on predicting the userâ€™s future behaviors (e.g., rating, clicking, watching, and purchasing) items but ignore the interactions between the user and the recommender agent. Therefore, they usually generate un-satisfactory recommendation results and cause bad user experience. This motivates the development of interactive recommender systems (IRS) that encourage the interactions between the user and the recommender agent. In recent years, interactive recommender systems have attracted increasingly research attentions from both academia and industry. This workshop provides a forum for researchers and practitioners to share the new techniques and applications of interactive recommender systems, and discuss the future research directions.
